# Smarto Releases **the SmartBoard** solution to its schools and colleges.

#### _**Students using SmartBoards tend to have 5x times more attention span.**_

March 29th, 2022. Smarto is eager to announce the SmartBoard. It is the classroom whiteboard at your fingertips. SmartBoard is not just any JamBoard it has a feature like real-time chat, Screen Sharing, and also a controlled flow. We designed this product keeping in mind the student's and teachers' real-time classroom experiences.

Students are struggling to study from recorded videos since their doubts are not cleared on time and also not able to collaborate with friends to understand the topics clearly. The attention span of a student is gradually decreasing due to a lack of interaction. Now students are truly missing the classroom WhiteBoard experience and even forgetting it.

SmartBoard solves this problem by integrating it into their existing Jam rooms. Which is do not require existing students and teachers to onboard again. They can experience a seamless virtual classroom experience at their fingertips. Also, integrated real-time chat system where teachers can control the flow of students' doubts just like in a classroom. Apart from that we also have a screen sharing feature integrated into it which helps teachers to check Assignments in real-time.

"We truly believe that students are our future and we will do everything in our hands to make sure that we all have a very bright future". We tested with 9th & 10th class students, we are proud of their feedback. We are constantly improving and adding more features in the coming days to make it more accessible and student-friendly.

"_Smart Boards are just like whiteboards, I am thoroughly enjoying interactive sessions with teachers and friends."_

_"I really really like the hands raise feature where I get a notification of the student doubt without disturbing the flow of the class."_

Log on to Smarto and click on JamRooms to find your classrooms start experiencing your SmartBoard. It is in beta mode now so, please fill out the given feedback form after the Virtual class ends.
