### Empathize

The City of Chicago is building; we have to make sure this city has the best infrastructure and traffic system in the world. The population is huge we have to make sure there are no jams in the intersections and people can travel from one point to another hassle-free

### Define

The main problem with the Chicago intersection is that it should accompany all kinds of people and vehicles to reach their homes/offices safely on time.

### Ideate

**We are prioritizing the people with less safety on road (pedestrians) to the highest heavy vehicles (trucks) on road.**

*   [x] Pedestrians and cyclers will have footpaths where they can move quickly and safely since there won’t be any blockage we can keep it as since the density of people pedestrians are less
*   [x] We will use the red signal for Pedestrians to cross the roads.
*   [x] We can keep the traffic light red until the opposite road light is red.
*   [x] We take the help of face detection to make sure it senses people's faces and don’t turn the light green until pedestrians cross the road even if the timer is zero.
*   [x] To make sure the light vehicles/two-wheelers keep moving without any blockage, we will have a separate line alongside the footpath we can name it service road.
*   [x] We can use main roads for 4 wheelers and other medium-sized vehicles.
*   [x] We can clear the traffic faster if we allow two lanes of vehicles to move at a time when the traffic light turns green.
*   [x] We identified the peak hours of traffic as 08 AM – 11 AM and 06 PM – 09 PM. These are generally office hours. To make sure safety and time in mind we will not allow heavy vehicles to travel during peak hours.
*   [x] Also, to make sure everyone follows traffic rules we use cameras at every intersection to detect the rule breaker and fine them.

### Future Work

*   [ ] For future work, we need to create flyovers for fast and heavy vehicles with a minimum speed in mind so that they can travel anytime with fewer intersections.
*   [ ] We can also change the traffic lights to yellow blinking from 11 PM – 5 AM when the traffic is very less. Vehicles can move continuously during these times.
