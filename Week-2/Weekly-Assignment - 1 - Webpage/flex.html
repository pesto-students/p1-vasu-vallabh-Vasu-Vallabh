				When you go grocery shopping, do you reach for whole wheat flour or regular wheat flour? Making the right choice can be challenging with phrases like whole wheat, whole grain, and multigrain printed over every product. Well, don’t worry, we are here to help you navigate through these terms, so that the next time you go grocery shopping, you can make a healthier decision.
			</p>

			<p>
				White flour is what most people reach for first when they go shopping, and it is the star ingredient in a variety of baked goods and bread. However, not all flours are made equal. White flour is manufactured from refined and processed wheat grains, so the nutritional value is a little low. Whole-wheat flour is prepared from crushed wheat kernels and incorporates every part of the bran. The wheat germ and bran give the flour a deeper color and higher nutritional value.
			</p>

			<h3>High Fibre</h3>
			<p>
				The difference in fiber levels of whole-wheat flour and white flour adds the most significant nutritional differences. Organic whole-wheat flour has a high fiber content, avoids constipation, decreases blood cholesterol, and may help you lose weight.
				On the other hand, white flour contains less fiber than whole-grain flour because the refining process separates the fiber-rich bran from the rest of the grain.
			</p>

			<h3>Regulates Blood Sugar</h3>
			<p>
				Any carbohydrate-containing food, including those using whole wheat or white flour, influences your blood sugar levels. After a meal, your body converts the carbohydrates in your meals into glucose, a simple sugar.
				The Glycemic Index or GI of food serves as a measure of how quickly this process occurs. Whole wheat flour has a lower GI compared to your regular wheat flour. It helps you absorb your food better and prevents your blood sugar from suddenly spiking or crashing
			</p>

			<h3>Improves Gut Health</h3>
			<p>
				Thanks to its high fiber content, wheat bran has a prebiotic effect on the human gut bacteria. It helps break down the good bacteria in your gastrointestinal system and improves digestion. It can also help you increase nutritional uptake in your body as it contains a variety of vitamins, including B-1, B-3, and B-5, which keep your gut health in check.
